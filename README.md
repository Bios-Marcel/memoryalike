# Memoryalike

Just a tiny terminal game where you have to remember the characters presented
to you and hit the respective key when they are hidden by a box. It's kinda
like memory.

## How to use it

It's not done yet, so it's basically useless.

You need to download Golang 1.14 or later and either create an executable
with `go build .` or run it directly via `go run .`.

## What's up with the name

That's as far as my imagination goes.
